Run the file in python console with:

import bpy  
import os  
  
filename = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(bpy.data.filepath), "CalculateMomentumPaths.py")  
exec(compile(open(filename).read(), filename, 'exec'))

Panel is on the 'Tools Misc' tab.

Setup
    Create a system of objects (Could be a mixture of armature bones and regular objects)
    Add a mass object to represent the center of mass for each of these objects. Place the

    For groups that are systems of masses check the "isSystem" box
    Click enable momentum trail button
    Set the range "before" and "after"
